# Matrix Multiply
Multiplies two matrices and writes the result to a file. If the correct arguments are not input, the program will send an error message.

### Option 1
Enter two valid file names in the command line.
matrix files should start with the matrix values on the first line, with each row element separated by a space and each new row indicated by a new line

Example of file text format:  
2 3  
4 5

The two files of valid format and compatability will be multiplied together and the result will be written to a file called "matrix3.txt"

### Option 2
Enter into the command line an integer value.  

This integer value will be used as the size dimensions to create two square matrices filled with random numbers. These generated matrices will be written to files "matrix1.txt" and "matrix2.txt".  

The two matrices will then be multiplied together and the result will be written to the file "matrix3.txt".
